## 💻 About Me

I build software systems aimed to solve real-world problems, with a focus on sustainability, inclusion, and practical impact. I enjoy working across the stack, designing and implementing software, analyzing data, and turning technical work into solutions that are reliable, scalable, and meaningful.

I’m currently a fellow in Cornell’s Break Through AI program, where I’m gaining hands-on experience applying machine learning in real-world settings while collaborating with industry mentors. Through this work and my academic projects, I’ve strengthened my skills in software development, debugging, and system-level thinking, alongside data analysis and model evaluation.

I’m actively seeking post-graduation opportunities where I can contribute as a software engineer with strong data and machine learning foundations. I’m always excited to connect and learn about interesting teams, projects, and opportunities!!
